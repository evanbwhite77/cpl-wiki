## IRB Overview {#irb_overview}

Welcome to the CPL IRB Resources page! Project managers should visit
this page at the start of their project to navigate the IRB process.
This page contains links to decision trees to help you decide what form
to fill out, and templates to help you fill out any forms (protocols)
should you need to.

As a research organization that often works with individual-level data,
our research is governed by the Institutional Review Boards at each
campus (the UC Berkeley [Committee for Protection of Human
Subjects](https://cphs.berkeley.edu/) or the UCLA [North General
IRB](http://ora.research.ucla.edu/OHRPP/Pages/IRB.aspx)) and the [State
of California Committee for the Protection of Human
Subjects](https://oshpd.ca.gov/data-and-reports/data-resources/cphs/#access).

Not all projects need to be reviewed by the IRB. The Principal
Investigator (PI) is, in the end, responsible for determining the level
of IRB review that is necessary. However, the Director for Partnerships
and Privacy can provide guidance in that determination, and can help
with the submission. Below are guides to help you navigate the process.

Note: depending on the level of review needed the **approval process can
take 2+ months**. That's why it's very important to start the process
early and to build these processes into your timelines.

CPL has developed decision trees and guides to help CPL researchers and
faculty affiliates navigate the IRB process.

## Who is responsible for the process? {#who_is_responsible_for_the_process}

-   **Project Managers** are in charge of leading the conversation
    around what type of IRB is needed, filling out forms, and embedding
    the review process into the project timeline
-   **Principal Investigators** are responsible for the decisions on
    which application to use, and content of each application
-   **Director of Data Partnerships and Privacy** can review
    applications before they are submitted upon request, will submit
    reliance forms as needed, and can answer questions from the project
    team along the way

## When should I start the process? {#when_should_i_start_the_process}

If you are drafting an exhibit or a DUA, you should begin the IRB
process. Otherwise, begin as early as possible once the research
question is set.

## When should I amend an application? {#when_should_i_amend_an_application}

You should submit an amendment if you are adding a component to your
project that involves:

-   A different research question
-   A different dataset
-   A different mode of data collection, or an update to that type of
    data collection (e.g. survey, focus group)
-   Any other potential change/increase in risk

## Is my study exempt from review? {#is_my_study_exempt_from_review}

For a human subjects research study study to be exempt from campus IRB
review it must fall into one of eight federally defined categories.
[Read the full list
here.](https://ora.research.ucla.edu/OHRPP/Documents/Policy/4/Exempt_List_2018_RCR.pdf)
Category 4i and 4ii are the most likely candidates for exemption at CPL.
Even when you believe your study should be exempt from review, you still
**must** submit a completed protocol to your respective campus IRB
office in order to receive that determination.

Projects do not involve human subjects data or do not qualify as
research do not need be reviewed by campus IRB offices.

The distinction between \"research that is determined to be exempt\" and
\"research that does not require review\" seems slight, but it is
significant. Importantly, while in some cases CPL can \"self-certify\"
that a project that does not require IRB review, **an exemption from
review can only be provided by the IRB after review of a submitted
protocol.**

If it is not clear whether your project requires IRB review or may
qualify for exemption, the best course of action is to email your
respective campus IRB office for advice **before** you begin the
project.

## Start here: IRB decision trees {#start_here_irb_decision_trees}

-   If you are working with a **State of California
    department/office/agency** for a project, or that entity is passing
    data onto CPL: use the [state IRB decision
    tree](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1eQM_1M39uHDgKUI3wEBxRiuSRsO6GUKg/view?usp=sharing).
-   **All other projects** (e.g. projects with a local government
    partner, school, or a non profit): use the [Campus IRB decision
    tree](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Gcfh0gOZWr_Tb89_EEoUS0VYoGrDSMRk/view?usp=sharing)
    (Note: it's the same for UCLA and UC Berkeley).

## CPL IRB guides and boilerplate language {#cpl_irb_guides_and_boilerplate_language}

Each decision tree will lead you to the appropriate section of each CPL
guide to the state and campus IRBs. You can also access each guide
through the links below:

    IRB](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1izrxfijPg62AI9qJuGE9spCIB3rVmUepQO9znA9Zsyc/edit)**
-   CPL Guide to the **[Campus
    IRBs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zQyr7LHdDlmXkjYoSdkukBw5zCCetDJlaKa0bVrSygw/edit#heading=h.rhrbmtpjx5do)**
