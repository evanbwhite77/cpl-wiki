## Introduction to eScholarship {#introduction_to_escholarship}

[eScholarship](https://escholarship.org/uc/ucb/about) is the University
of California\'s open-access scholarly publishing and repository service
for departments, research units, publishing programs, and individual
scholars to create and disseminate their scholarship.

CPL has a dedicated page on UC Berkeley\'s eScholarship site - see [CPL
eScholarship](https://escholarship.org/uc/iir_cpl) where we publish
research under the following categories:

-   Policy Briefs
-   Research Reports (including data points)
-   Academic and Working Papers
-   White Papers

All staff can register for an account but submissions must be approved
by CPL\'s eScholarship administrator: Anna Doherty, CPL Berkeley
(annadoherty\@berkeley.edu). Once publications are uploaded, they cannot
be removed.

## What should be posted on eScholarship? {#what_should_be_posted_on_escholarship}

Any research output that is ready to go on our website, or that is an
academic publication, can be posted eScholarship. This includes policy
briefs and memos, white papers, working papers and academic
publications.

In particular, publications from CPL research funded by the UC
Multicampus Research Programs and Initiatives (MRPI) grants are required
to be published on eScholarship. See [MRPI publishing
requirements](https://www.wiki.capolicylab.org/index.php?title=EScholarship#MRPI_publishing_requirements)
for specific instructions.

## What is the process for publishing on eScholarship? {#what_is_the_process_for_publishing_on_escholarship}

-   The relevant research team is responsible to identify publications
    to be posted to eScholarship, with support from the CPL eScholarship
    Administrator, CPL Development Director and CPL Executive Director.
    *They are also responsible for ensuring ALL relevant partners and
    researchers have approved the publication for public release.*

-   Once a publication is ready to publish, the researcher can [create
    an eScholarship
    account](https://submit.escholarship.org/subi/register) and then
    \"Deposit\" the submission via the [UC Berkeley eScholarship main
    page](https://escholarship.org/uc/ucb).

```{=html}

```
-   The **Content Submission** section of [IRLE\'s eScholarship
    guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xoSa8vmdGeyX7dgzXYqAJNctHavr8Zz49Or_hkNPpwc/edit#heading=h.m11yjfulxsvy)
    (internal) provides step-by-step instructions on making a
    submission - **note, CPL publications need to be associated with the
    [CPL eScholarship](https://escholarship.org/uc/iir_cpl) page.**

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   Notify the CPL eScholarship administrator
    (annadoherty\@berkeley.edu) that the submission is ready for review
    and approval.

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   Email help\@escholarship.org to provide the specific URL for the
    publication on the CPL eScholarship page and ask for it to be
    cross-posted to the MRPI page.

**Considerations**

-   Once a publication is published on eScholarship, it cannot be edited
    or removed. For this reason, it is imperative that all relevant
    partner approvals are finalized by the research team, and that any
    co-author or researcher listed on the publication is made aware,
    prior to publication.

## MRPI publishing requirements {#mrpi_publishing_requirements}

Publications from CPL research funded by the UC Multicampus Research
Programs and Initiatives (MRPI) grants are required to be published on
eScholarship and include the following reference: \"UC Office of the
President, Multicampus Research Programs and Initiatives, MRP-19-600774
and M21PR3278\"

-   MRP-19-600774 covers work in 2018 -- 2020
-   M21PR3278 covers work in 2021 -- 2024

Once these are uploaded to the [CPL
eScholarship](https://escholarship.org/uc/iir_cpl) page, they should
also be added to the [MRPI
eScholarship](https://escholarship.org/uc/ucri_mrpi) page as well.

To do this, the CPL administrator or relevant researcher should email:
help\@escholarship.org to provide the specific URL for the publication
on the CPL eScholarship page and ask for it to be cross-posted to the
MRPI page.
