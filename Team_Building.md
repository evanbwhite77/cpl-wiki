## Purpose

Teambuilding helps CPL staff members feel happier at work. People who
are happier at work are rated by others as more likable, more
trustworthy, more deserving of respect and attention, and more effective
leaders. At happier workplaces, people are also more helpful to each
other and more supportive of one another during difficult times. Happier
workplaces also report less turnover, lower health care costs, fewer
mistakes, more efficiency. They also earn higher \"customer\" loyalty,
commitment, and growth via word-of-mouth endorsement. We want to
cultivate all this at CPL. One easy way to create a culture of workplace
happiness is via teambuilding, social, and family events. CPL invests in
numerous kinds of teambuilding activities throughout the year including
social events like happy hours & birthday day refreshments, as well as
family events like picnics, BBQs, and holiday parties. Due to most grant
requirements, as well as UC Berkeley rules and guidelines, it is
encouraged to discuss any teambuilding activities with the Operations
Manager, Executive Director, or HR Operations Associate during the
planning stages to ensure compliance with all standards. All team
building expenses will need to be approved before by the operations
manager. When requesting approval for funds, see the below checklist for
things to include.
