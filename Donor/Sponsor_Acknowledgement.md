## Overview

Some donors wish to be acknowledged while others wish to remain
anonymous. It\'s critical to understand which side of the aisle your
donor falls so that CPL may appropriately disclose information about
grants, gifts, and contracts. Below is information on each CPL donor.

**Wellspring Philanthropic Fund**

**Here is the exact 2017 language describing permitted uses of the name
Wellspring. Note that we should only disclose their funding in PRIVATE
documents like proposals to donors. Otherwise they need to remain
anonymous.**

Earlier this year, your organization was awarded a grant from Wellspring
Philanthropic Fund (WPF), for which Wellspring Advisors, LLC acts as the
Administrative Agent.

Section 11 of the grant agreement (which addresses attribution of the
grant) provides that your organization may identify WPF as the source of
grant funds in any ordinary public listing of donors, such as commonly
appears in an annual report or IRS Form 990.

Notwithstanding this provision, WPF requests that your organization
adhere to the following guidance with respect to the attribution of your
grant from WPF:

-   Your organization may identify WPF as the source of funds in any
    legally required listing of donors, like the listings required as
    schedules to a Form 990 return or other government filing.
-   Your organization may also identify WPF as a source of funds in any
    non-public communications with other donors or collaborators, or in
    response to any third-party inquiry, if such disclosure would
    advance your organization's interests.
-   Your organization should NOT identify WPF as a source of funds in
    any public listings of donors where such inclusion is not legally
    required (like the listings that typically appear in annual reports,
    event programs or web sites), or in any press release, newsletter or
    other similar mass communication.
