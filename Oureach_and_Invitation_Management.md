Investing time and effort into an outreach and communications plan
pre-event is one of the most important and under-utilized aspects of
event management. Successful event outreach and communications begins as
soon as the event planning begins,

1\) reaching out to keynote speakers before confirming dates, then

2\) building out a comprehensive invite list to send \"save the date\"
invites to at least three months in advance of the event.

## Timeline

-   4-6 months out: reach out to potential keynote speakers
-   4-6 months out: create comprehensive list of invitees
-   3-5 months out: confirm keynote
-   3-5 months out: send out \"save the date\" invites
-   3 months out: send out official invites
-   1-2 months out: send out reminder emails
-   1-2 weeks out: send final local logistics email

## Checklist

**Questions to consider first:**

-   Is this event open or closed?
-   How large is your ideal audience? Who is your ideal audience?
-   How much time will attendees need to plan their trips? Will
    attendees need visas?
-   Will you coordinate or cover travel?
-   Do these things:
-   Reach out to potential keynote speakers
-   Create comprehensive list of invitees
-   Send out \"save the date\" invites
-   Send out official invites
-   Send out reminder emails
-   Send final local logistics email
