## Background

(more details forthcoming) The Santa Clara Public Defender\'s Office is
the public defense agency in Santa Clara County.

## CPL Research Partnership {#cpl_research_partnership}

CPL is partnering with SCPD to evaluate their new Pre Arraignment Review
and Release unit (PARR), which provides early representation to indigent
defendants post-booking into the Santa Clara jail and pre-arraignment.
The unit and evaluation are modelled on San Francisco\'s Pretrial
Release Unit (PRU), which CPL evaluated in 2018.

PARR\'s pilot launched at the end of 2019 and the research partnership
began in fall of 2019. PARR is offering services to defendants on a
rotating weekly schedule, CPL will leverage the resulting quasi-random
offering of treatment to evaluate the impact that early representation
has on a host of outcomes, including:

-   release from custody at arraignment
-   likelihood of charges being filed
-   likelihood of charges being reduced
-   bail amount
-   case outcomes (e.g., conviction rate)
-   sentencing and sentence lengths
