Purpose Steps Purpose All CPL staff should use the standardized email
signature. **(note to Evan: I am not sure if you want to include this)**

## Steps

1\. Go to this link **(note to Evan: need to go back to CEGA wiki page
to find the link)**

2\. Enter your information

3\. Ignore \"department.\"

4\. Please enter \*\*the sector(s)\*\* you support, not the programs.
See mockup for Leah below. Operations staff won\'t use these fields.

-   There are two address fields: first line = first field, second line
    = second field.

5\. You are invited to add your pronouns to your signature. This is of
course voluntary. Including your pronouns (in signatures, name tags,
etc) is an inclusive practice that makes \"\...spaces more inclusive of
transgender, gender nonconforming, and gender non-binary people.
Including pronouns is a first step toward respecting people's gender
identity, working against cisnormativity, and creating a more welcoming
space for people of all genders.\" (reference: GLSEN). Note it\'s best
to use \"pronouns\" instead of \"preferred pronouns\".

6\. Hit \"generate.\"

7\. Your email signature will be produced in the adjacent screen. Copy
it (ctr / command A or by highlighting and copying).

8\. Go to settings in gmail (the wheel icon in the upper right corner)
and click \"settings.\" See screenshot below.

9\. Paste your new signature in the \"signature\" section of the
\"general\" tab and click save. You can go back into email Settings to
edit any time.
