## Purpose

Research can be more relevant and policy more equitable when diverse
perspectives are integrated and diverse groups included (and some
funders require us to consider them when implementing funded
activities). This page is a repository of best practices and resources
for promoting diversity and inclusion at CPL events and trainings.

## Checklist

Take stock of past events/trainings. How diverse has your speaker
line-up or audience been historically? This will have implications for
how you plan future events. Consider diversity and inclusion at each
stage of event planning (see Steps below) Get feedback! What do we mean
when we talk about diversity? Gender Sexuality Race, ethnicity Age
Ability Socio-economic background and access to opportunity Academic
discipline Religion or lack thereof "Starting now, I expect a level
playing field at public speaking events with a diversity of ideas or I
will decline to participate. I challenge other leaders to do the same."
Ending the #manel --- panels with all male speakers --- begins at the
top, says Francis Collins, the director of the National Institutes of
Health. (NIH) (Nature Daily Briefing, June 13, 2019)

## Timeline

The earlier you start thinking about diversity and inclusion, the easier
it is to operationalize! Some practices require more funding, so
consider them at the proposal/budget development stage!

## Steps

Below is a (non-exhaustive) list of considerations to take when planning
events.

**1. Event theme/training topic**

-   Be aware that some themes and topic are likely to be more relevant
    to specific groups. This is not always an issue, but when planning,
    always ask who is likely to attend.

**2. Venue**

-   Consider accessibility for disabled attendees (event venues and
    accommodations)
-   Consider live streaming, recording, or providing other opportunities
    for remote participation for those who cannot attend at all

**3. Dates**

-   Consider religious holidays and school holidays

**4. Outreach**

-   Try to cast as wide a net as possible and reach out to groups who
    target diverse communities

**5. Event activities**

-   Conventional talks w/ Q&A are often the easiest activities to plan,
    which can be fine. But activities like open discussions, trainings,
    match-making, etc. can create space for deeper engagement and
    participation by more attendees.
-   Providing networking opportunities during formal event hours (in
    addition to happy hours that parents might not be able to attend)

**6. Catering** -- Consider dietary restrictions, e.g.

-   health-related: e.g., vegetarian, dairy, etc.
-   religion-related: e.g., pork, beef, or any meat products

**7. Speakers**

-   No man-els! Ever.
-   Diverse review committees can lead to more diverse line-ups
-   Offering childcare can lower barriers for mothers (and fathers) to
    attend events

**8. Create an inclusive environment**

-   Codes of conduct -- Have one (see CPL Code of Conduct below), make
    it clear that it\'s important, and be ready to enforce it!
-   If men are dominating discussion, small gestures such as shuttling
    mics to female audience members or having a female staff person
    first ask a question can encourage more women to participate

**9. Request feedback**

-   Offer opportunities for anonymous feedback
