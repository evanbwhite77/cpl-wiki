## Purpose/Overview

It can often be easiest to pay for event expenses out of pocket, and
then reimburse yourself or travelers after the event is over. After the
event, it is important to submit the reimbursement request as soon as
possible to avoid delays in payment. Checklist All receipts, flight
itineraries, etc. If the request is to reimburse someone outside of the
UC system, make sure they are vendored correctly (see Vendoring)

## Timeline

Submit reimbursement requests ASAP after the event ends. Reimbursements
must be submitted within 45 days of the expenditure.

## Steps

1\. If the person being reimbursed is a UC Berkeley staff, student,
faculty, see Reimbursement (UC Berkeley employee)

2\. If the person being reimbursed works outside of UC Berkeley, see
(Reimbursement (non UC Berkeley recipient and UC Berkeley students)
