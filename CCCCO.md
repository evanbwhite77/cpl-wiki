# California Community Colleges Chancellor\'s Office {#california_community_colleges_chancellors_office}

The California Community Colleges Chancellor\'s Office (CCCCO) oversees
all of California\'s 115 community colleges.

## CPL Research Partnership {#cpl_research_partnership}

CPL-Berkeley partnered with CCCCO to undertake an analysis of regional
variation amongst California\'s community colleges, using administrative
data from CCCCO. We produced a
report[1](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1FaAsGFw0QuAuW3wp27nEAtQvsjeUiS13)
with the results of this analysis in March 2019, but it has yet to be
published. We are in the process of updating this analysis with K-12
data from the California Department of Education.

We are currently working with CCCCO to start a second research
partnership that will involve merging data from many different sources,
including the California Student Aid Commission, the Franchise Tax
Board, the California Department of Social Services, and others, the
purpose of which is to identify students who are eligible for food
stamps or other social programs, but who are not currently taking them
up.

## Data Holdings {#data_holdings}

CCCCO holds a range of data on community college students, including
demographics, course taking, grades, etc. We have some of this
information from 2011 onwards.

## Data Linking {#data_linking}

We are discussing receiving identified data from CCCCO for the purpose
of linking to CDE CalPads data, but have yet to perform this linkage.
