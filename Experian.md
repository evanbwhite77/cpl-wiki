## IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER {#important_disclaimer}

We have a nondisclosure agreement with Experian about the fact that they
are the source of this data. When referencing it to outside parties,
please refer to it as the UC Consumer Credit Panel (UCCCP), not as the
Experian data.

## Background

Experian is one of the three credit bureaus and, as such, has credit
data for everyone with credit in the country. We purchased a portion of
this data from them in December 2019.

## CPL Research Partnership {#cpl_research_partnership}

Our partnership with them is just a data partnership, not a research
partnership. We are intending to use their data for various projects and
to make it available to researchers.

## Data Holdings {#data_holdings}

We have received part of, and will receive the rest of, two
complimentary datasets from Experian. One covers a 2% sample of everyone
in their system (i.e. roughly 2% of everyone with credit in the US). The
other is a full sample of Californians with credit, including everyone
who has resided in the state at any point since 2004. This will include
their data before, during, and after their tenure in the state.

For both datasets, we will receive quarterly archives from March 2004 to
present. Each archive consists of four files, corresponding to the
person-level attributes, full set of tradelines, public records (mostly
bankruptcies), and hard inquiries of everyone in the sample.

This data is stored as both a set of CSVs and as a Postgres database.

## Data Linking {#data_linking}

We have not as yet linked Experian\'s data to anything.
