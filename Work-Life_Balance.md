## Overview

Work--life balance is the term used to describe the balance that an
individual needs between time allocated for work and other aspects of
life like personal interests, family, and social or leisure activities.

In our rush to "get it all done" at CPL (and at home), it's easy to
forget that as our stress levels spike, our productivity plummets.
Stress can zap our concentration, make us irritable or depressed, and
negatively impact our personal and professional relationships. Over
time, stress also weakens our immune systems, and makes us susceptible
to a variety of ailments from colds to backaches to heart disease--not
to mention generates feelings of general malaise and unhappiness!

While we all need a certain amount of stress to spur us on and help us
perform at our best, the key to managing stress lies in that one magic
word: **balance**. Not only is achieving a healthy work-life balance an
attainable goal, but staffers and CPL alike see the rewards. When staff
members are balanced and happy, they are more productive, make fewer
mistakes, take fewer sick days, and are more likely to stay in their
jobs.

Towards this end, CPL has embraced several practices to infuse work-life
balance into our office culture: from telecommuting, coaching, and
flexible vacations, to workplace safety/ergonomics, staff social/family
events, and workfit classes. Below are a several tips to ensuring a
strong work-life balance at CPL (compiled from various sources), as well
as links to relevant wiki pages.

## Checklist

-   **Set manageable goals each day:** Meeting priorities everyday is
    motivating, and gives us a sense of accomplishment and control. Set
    realistic expectations each day.
-   **Be nice and thank your colleagues:** We're happier at work when we
    tap into our innate tendency towards kindness---orienting our
    thoughts, feelings, and actions towards care for others and
    genuinely supportive social bonds. Being kind at work involves
    treating others with dignity and respect, extending empathy and
    compassion, practicing gratitude, and constructively managing
    conflicts. See the \"feedback\" wiki page for information on how to
    provide feedback and solicit critical (and helpful) input.
-   **Mentoring and coaching:** CPL encourages mentorship and coaching,
    with the goal of helping our colleagues reach their potential and
    emphasizing a culture of ongoing learning. We hope that this CPL
    value (capacity building) helps us feel more engaged and purposeful,
    and ultimately achieve greater work-life balance.
-   **Telecommuting at CPL:** CPL staff typically have the option of
    working remotely one day per week. We hope this flexibility helps
    staff feel more productive and engaged, while achieving greater
    work-life balance.
-   **Flexible vacations:** Vacation is important! CPL staff are often
    afforded flexility to take vacation even if they are not officially
    allowed to do so (i.e. they are within their 6-month probationary
    period) or have not accrued sufficient vacation hours. See this wiki
    page for more detail.
-   **Workplace safety and ergonomics:** feeling safe and healthy at
    work means that staff members are more productive, engaged, and
    happy. Check out this wiki page to learn more about ergonomics at
    CPL.
-   **Staff social and family events:** CPL hosts several social and
    family events every year because they\'re fun and we like each
    other! They also reinforce team building across the Center and help
    us get to know each (and our families) other even better.
-   **Workfit classes:** UC Berkeley faculty and staff can take
    advantage of 50+ workout classes per week at a significantly
    discounted rate. Working out at work (or just taking a break) has
    big benefits in terms of productivity, health, and overall
    happiness.
