## Mechanics

The mechanics of moving files onto the server are these:

**1.** Connect to the VPN

**2.** Connect to Jupiter via an FTP client (such as Filezilla) using
your log-in information sent to you by Irfan

**3.** Transfer files via the FTP

**4.** Check the \"ftpsync\" folder on your server desktop. Within 5
minutes the transferred files should show up there

**5.** Move the transferred files to the proper folder on the server.
Delete the files from the \"ftpsync\" folder

**6.** In the event that the files are original data files that also
need to be backed up to the project\'s \"OriginalData\" folder, contact
the CPL Help Desk
