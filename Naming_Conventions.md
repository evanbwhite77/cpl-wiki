Documents stored on the Google Drive automatically save your version
history, reducing the need for suffixes to be used in our file names.

If you do need to create alternative versions of a document here are
some guidelines

-   Clearly distinguish what the difference is in your two versions (Eg
    \"_internal_only\" and \"for_external_use\")

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   If you need to use the date in your filename it should be in
    **YYYYMMDD** format, which ensures sorting will be ascending or
    descending by date.

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   _V2, _final, _finalV2, _test and other similarly meaningless
    file suffixes are NOT acceptable.
