myearian\@berkeley.edu, 664-9368), or contact the CPL HR Associate with
any questions.

## UCPath

UCPath is the University of California\'s single Human Resources (HR),
Payroll, Benefits and Academic Personnel system for all UC Employees
(faculty, staff, and student employees such as GSRs, student
assistants). The employee self-service portal, UCPath Online, will be
live on March 30, 2019. You'll be able to access UCPath Online through a
link on the Berkeley UCPath website home page. To report any issues with
pay, benefits, or your personal info, call the First Contact Team (FCT)
at (510) 664-9000 or email hrapscsshelp\@berkeley.edu. You can also let
the HR Associate know and they will contact our HR partners.

The Ops team will use UCPath to set up new positions, initiate funding
approvals for new hires, change payroll distributions, etc.

**Through the employee self-service (ESS) portal, CPL staff can view and
update personal, payroll, and benefits information such as:**

-   Update name, address, phone number, emergency contacts
-   Review leave balances
-   Add, delete, or update direct deposit
-   Review online pay statement
-   Update federal tax withholding
-   Update California tax withholding
-   Enroll in benefits
-   Enter life event(s)
-   At Your Service Online (AYSO)
-   We will still use AYSO, but only for retirement information and
    historical payroll information. Other features that used to be found
    in AYSO (current paystubs, direct deposit, W-2s, benefits, etc) are
    now in UCPath.

## Health & Other Benefits {#health_other_benefits}

UC Berkeley offers a comprehensive benefits package including health,
disability, & retirement. Employees select benefits within 30 days of
hire and can change benefits every year in October during Open
Enrollment. Note if a new employee chooses to waive health insurance (ie
and stay on their parent\'s or partner\'s plan), they are eligible to
enroll at any subsequent open enrollment. Benefits Orientations for
staff members are offered every Monday at 10:00AM (location TBC, no
appointment needed)\--staff can attend at any point throughout their
career. Please review the UC Complete Guide to Health and Welfare
Benefits document or visit the UC Berkeley benefits or UC Health Net
websites for detailed information about UC benefits.

**High-level facts:** Note as a new employee you will be eligible for
benefits effective your first day of hire. However, you will not be able
to sign up on UCPath until 5-7 business days after you receive your
employee ID from the campus HR team. If you try to apply before then and
are unsuccessful, please wait a few more days or complete this form and
submit it directly to UCPath (our central HR, Payroll and Benefits
portal) as an inquiry. Should you need to see a doctor before this
process has ended, please take care of yourself first and notify UCPath
of the name of the doctor and facility immediately afterward, so they
can assist in facilitating payment for services. Submit a Service Now
request adding our HR Partner Max Yearian to the watchlist with any
questions. You can also contact Max if you\'re having difficulty
enrolling in health insurance.

**Health Plans:**

-   Medical - UC covers most of the cost of the monthly premiums:
-   \[HMO\] Health Net Blue & Gold (a network designed just for UC )
-   \[HMO\] Kaiser (closed network of doctors and hospitals)
-   \[PPO\] UC Care (includes Anthem Blue Cross PPO network)
-   \[PPO\] UC Health Savings Plan (a PPO with a health savings account
    that allows you to contribute tax-free)
-   Dental (Delta Dental PPO or Delta Care USA HMO) - UC pays 100% of
    the premium
-   Vision (VSP) - UC pays 100% of the premium
-   Disability, Life & Accident Insurance
-   For detailed information see the UC Net website.
-   Disability Insurance: UC's employer-paid disability insurance offers
    some protection - covers pregnancy, illness or unexpected injury ---
    but it's capped at \$800/month for six months. For a modest monthly
    premium, additional \*Supplemental Disability Insurance can replace
    much more of your income (advised if you plan to become pregnant).
-   Life Insurance: UC provides basic life insurance at no cost.
-   Accidental Death and Dismemberment: For a small monthly premium, you
    may enroll in AD&D (Accidental Death and Dismemberment) coverage. If
    you didn\'t enroll in AD&D when you were first hired you can enroll
    via the UPAY form.

## Behavioral Health {#behavioral_health}

UC's medical coverage includes mental health services and substance
abuse treatment services through Optum or Anthem Blue Cross.

## Retirement and Savings {#retirement_and_savings}

Saving for retirement is important and UC offers different packages for
different employees. If you were hired before July 1, 2016, see this
page, if you were hired after July 1, 2016 visit this page. UC now
allows employees to opt into a pension fund, in addition to signing up
for an optional 403(b), managed by Fidelity and similar to a 401(k)
savings account, or sign up for a stand-alone 403(b) savings account,
also managed by Fidelity.

**Pension Options:** A pension is a fund into which a sum of money is
added during an employee\'s employment years, and from which payments
are drawn to support the person\'s retirement from work in the form of
periodic payments. UC offers two pension account options:

**Savings Choice:** You will Vest after one (1) year, meaning, if you
leave the University after you Vest, you will then be able to keep the
8% matching contribution from the University. However, if you leave
before you Vest, then you will only be entitled to you 7% contributions.
This plan works very similar to a 401(k), in what has been contributed
to the retirement account is what will be available to them
post-retirement.

**Pension Choice:** You will Vest after five (5) years, meaning if you
leave the University after you Vest, you will then be able to keep the
8% matching contribution from the University. However, if you leave
before you Vest, then you will only be entitled to you 7% contributions.
This plan works very similar to a pension, in that you will be given
income (a pension) for life, post-retirement.

**Quick Analysis:** Savings plan is best suited for staff who do not
plan to be at UC longer than 1 year & is more like a traditional 401k.
Pension choice takes longer to become vested and benefits seem more
robust. The biggest differences between the two plans lie in the amount
of time it takes for the employer contributions take to Vest and what
you receive post-retirement. To Vest means to acquire certain rights.
Once vested, you generally have a non-forfeitable right to receive UCRP
retirement benefits upon leaving the University and reaching retirement
age.

**Voluntary savings plans:** As an employee of the UC, you can also
participate in the other voluntary plans in the UC Retirement Savings
Program: the Tax-Deferred 403(b) Plan, the 457(b) Deferred Compensation
Plan, or the Defined Contribution Plan.

**UC Berkeley pension/savings workshops:** These decisions are important
and complicated so UC Berkeley offers a few resources and workshops to
help in decision making:

-   Preparing for retirement video
-   Retirement income calculator and resources
-   UC retirement class schedule
-   Fidelity consults and workshops
-   Other Benefits
-   UC offers many other benefits including Legal, Family Care, Flexible
    Spending Accounts, Tuition Discounts, Homeowner/Renters/Auto
    insurance, Business Travel insurance and more. Check out this
    website for details; high-level information below.

**Business Travel insurance:** When traveling on official university
business, faculty, staff, or any person designated by UC, will be
covered worldwide, 24 hours a day, for a wide variety of accidents and
incidents. Reservation booked with one of the two preferred Connexxus
Travel suppliers, BCD Travel or UC Travel Center, will automatically be
registered for traveler insurance coverage. Within minutes of completing
the reservation the traveler will be emailed information to use in an
emergency while traveling on UC business both domestically and abroad.
Coverage can also be provided to a spouse/domestic partner,
dependent(s), and traveling companions when traveling with them; their
travel should be registered. Coverage includes medical care and
evacuation, loss of personal property (UC employees only), extraction
for political and weather related reasons, and more.

**Family Care:** UC provides access to Bright Horizons Care Advantage, a
web-based resource for finding childcare, eldercare, and other family
care providers. Flexible Spending Accounts (FSA) allow you to pay
eligible expenses on a pretax, salary reduction basis (so it lowers your
taxable income). Dependent Care FSA (DepCare FSA) is for eligible
dependent care expenses (like daycare) and Health FSA is for eligible
health care expenses not covered by your medical, dental, or vision
plans.

**Legal Insurance:** For a small monthly premium you may enroll in ARAG
Legal Plan, which provides a wide range of legal services (ie estate
planning, etc). Tuition discounts: discounts on university classes.
WageWorks transportation discounts. A WageWorks Commuter Transit Account
is a pre-tax benefit account used to pay for public transit---including
train, BART, bus, ferry or vanpool---as part of your daily commute to
and from work. The University will cover up to a certain amount per
month. A WageWorks Commuter Parking Account is a pre-tax benefit account
used to pay for parking as part of your daily commute to and from work.

**Workfit:** UC Berkeley faculty and staff can take advantage of 50+
workout classes per week. See information on workfit, including class
schedule, on the workfit website. Calculating Benefits Eligibility

**Note:** this is CPL's understanding of the process, Central HR can
advise on any specific questions: Staff members do not typically receive
benefits for less than 50% effort The standard measurement period
(\"look-back\") is from November 1 - October 31 and is applied to the
next calendar year. (e.g. campus looks at your effort between November
1, 2016 - October 31, 2017 to determine if you are eligible for benefits
during 2018 calendar year). To be eligible for benefits, you must work a
minimum of 17.5 hours per week during the standard measurement period
November 1 - October 31 If you were at a lower level of effort from
November 1, 2016 - April 30, 2017, for example, your average effort
during the last standard measurement period may have been less than 17.5
hours/week In theory, if a staff member worked at least 17.5 hours/week
\*on average\* during the standard measurement period, they should be
eligible for benefits for the next calendar year. Ombuds The Staff
Ombuds Office is an independent department that provides strictly
confidential, impartial and informal conflict resolution and
problem-solving services for all Staff, Non-Senate Academics, and
Faculty who perform management functions. There is a parallel Ombuds
Office for Students and Postdocs.

**Note for Postdocs:** Postdocs are represented by a Union, and are
considered non-academic appointments. For info on the specifics of your
postdoc plan with Garnett Powers, contact Antonio Kontokanis at
1-949-583-2925 ext 1408 or Akontokanis\@garnett-powers.com. Resources
