## Conference Lines {#conference_lines}

If you use Uber Conference, you can (and should) change your hold music
once the \"I\'m on Hold\" jingle ceases to be funny. To do so, go to
**[your account](https://www.uberconference.com)** and then go to
\"settings\" in the drop down menu that appears when you mouse-over your
name in the upper right hand corner. You can also opt not to play the
hold music for the organizer, aka, yourself, though you\'ll need to
enter your organizer pin when joining your calls.
