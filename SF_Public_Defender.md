# SF Public Defender {#sf_public_defender}

## Background

The SF Public Defender is the public defender\'s office for the city and
county of San Francisco

## CPL Research Partnership {#cpl_research_partnership}

CPL partnered with SFPD to evaluate their pilot Pretrial Release Unit
(PRU), which provides early representation to some indigent defendants.
The pilot started in 2017 and was initially evaluated by Alena Yarmosky
as her masters project (APA) at the Goldman School.

CPL began an effort to expand this evaluation to include the full pilot
year and additional outcomes (beyond release at arraignemnt). However,
as of April 2020, this project is on hold pending additional data.

## Data Holdings {#data_holdings}

-   booking and arraignment data
-   case disposition data
-   PRU case notes

## Data Linking {#data_linking}

We have sought permission to link this data to data from other CJ
partners in San Francisco (SFDA, SF Sheriff), but have not received
permission to do so.
