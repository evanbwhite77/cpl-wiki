## Purpose

Feedback is all about making sure everyone knows what is expected of
them and clearly communicating the main focus areas of their work.
Mentors and Mentees should be providing each other feedback on a regular
basis. The main venues for feedback are weekly updates, weekly
check-ins, 360 Performance Evaluations, and ad-hoc meetings. Ongoing
feedback is critical in the work environment. Here are a few arguments
for why you should seriously invest in feedback: Short-term rewards -
feedback pays off in reduced stress and increased certainty, clears the
air, facilitates better allocation of tasks, cooperation. It shouldn't
be confrontational - we are all on the same team trying to achieve the
same goals. Professional improvement and working better together is in
the interest of all of us. It shouldn't be "I have this problem with my
mentor", but "My mentor and I have this problem, and we're working on
it.\" Think of a relationship! Medium-term rewards - feedback pays off
in improved performance. For both parties! It may be the most
cost-effective time investment for professional improvement. It\'s our
obligation to both our mentees and managers, to help them improve and
foster accountability.

## Timeline

**Regular feedback sessions should happen on a weekly basis during
updates or check-ins. Berkeley (and CPL) organizes the formal 360
feedback and review process every summer. Here are some general tips for
providing feedback to colleagues:**

-   Provide regular feedback!
-   Use soft language
-   Don\'t be time constrained
-   Try to have the feedback session in an uninterrupted environment,
    ideally different than ordinary.
-   Identify the \"mechanisms\" behind areas of improvements. First
    discuss areas of improvement and the colleague respond and explain.
    Together, devise actionable mechanisms that will help overcome these
    issues and improve. This \*achieves improvement and clears the bad
    atmosphere. Prepare ideas in advance in case your colleague doesn't
    have any, but also be open to suggestions from your colleague and
    let them go first - often theirs will be better. \*Check back on
    these mechanisms occasionally, not only in the next feedback
    session.

## Steps

**Weekly Updates:**

-   Every CPL staff member sends their manager a weekly progress update
    once a week. Each team decides on the day & time for the weekly
    progress update, thus this will vary across teams (i.e. updates for
    the global networks staff members are due Tuesday but updates for
    the operations staff members are due Friday). The update should
    include a summary of each accomplishment, meeting, or deliverable
    for the past week. It should also include your plans and target
    activities for the coming week. Weekly updates are also where you
    should note any schedule changes for upcoming week due to a
    doctor\'s appointment or vacation. Please be sure to include links
    in the update (box documents, event pages, google forms, etc). The
    manager submits the team's weekly progress update to the Executive
    Director. See example of a weekly update here.
-   This is a great venue for Managers to provide constructive feedback
    and kudos to team members in writing (so mentees can refer back to
    feedback in the future).

**360 Reviews:**

-   Prepare for feedback sessions (i.e. think of parameters for
    evaluation).
-   You can consult Berkeley's Core Competencies Matrix to get ideas.
-   You can also give feedback for other things that don't fall exactly
    into these set parameters. Think of moments where you were
    disappointed, or specific failures, but also expectations exceeded.
-   Collect ideas and examples over time, not only the week before your
    feedback - it makes it both more accurate and more credible. Keep
    them in a dedicated (discreet) section of your notes and add things
    when something comes up (cathartic bonus). That said, use them
    wisely - don't make your mentee feel you're nitpicking.
-   Review previous feedback session summaries and deliver your feedback
    in light of that: what areas improved, what didn't, and to not
    reinvent the wheel.
-   Use this feedback template to organize your thoughts and develop
    focused (not nit-picky) areas for growth and areas of strength.
    It\'s organized into three parts: a) mentee gives feedback on
    mentor, b) mentee on themselves, c) mentor on mentee.
-   Also use 360 reviews to update job descriptions and discuss
    milestones, deliverables and expectations. Everyone should know what
    they're being measured against and what's expected of them. This
    way, feedback is in context and never surprising.

**Feedback Follow ups:**

-   Check back on improvements periodically--don\'t just leave them
    hanging. Revisit mechanisms and areas of discussion through ad hoc
    meetings or weekly updates.
-   Keep written notes from your feedback. E-mail to yourself (or a
    document) is good for this.
-   E-mail your mentee your agreed summary & mechanisms.
-   Make sure you have how to review your colleague later. Make sure the
    mechanisms work, and revisit the ones that don't, preferably before
    the next feedback session.
