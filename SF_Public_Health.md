# San Francisco Department of Public Health {#san_francisco_department_of_public_health}

## Background

The San Francisco Department of Public Health launched the Coordinated
Case Management System (CCMS) in 2005. It has grown to include the
bio-psycho-social histories of over 600,000 adult high-risk / high-cost
patients. The Department began using this data to identify \"high users
of multiple systems\" (HUMS) in 2007 and is prioritizing this population
through its Whole Person Care program.

In 2019, the Department of Public Health recognized incarceration as a
public health issue and has committed to \"maximize efforts within its
control to prevent individuals from being incarcerated; to increase
collaboration, efficiency and effectiveness of medical and behavioral
health services across the continuum of care; to enhance and expand
post-release discharge planning, linkage to relevant services in the
community, and other reentry services; and to work on mitigating the
effects of incarceration on families and communities.\" Read the

## CPL Research Partnership {#cpl_research_partnership}

CPL Berkeley is launching a new project to link individual-level data
from the Department of Public Health\'s Coordinated Case Management
System (CCMS) to criminal justice data from the Sheriff and District
Attorney to measure the size and characteristics of frequent utilizers
of government services in San Francisco, prototypical service use
pattern, and any changes over time or difference across groups. We will
use the empirical results to understand the cycles of health service
utilization, homelessness, police contact, and incarceration; identify
the complex factors that drive their systems involvement; and model how
policy changes (such as jail discharge planning or diversion to
treatment programs) can impact outcomes.

## Data Holdings {#data_holdings}

We have service utilization and diagnoses data for 210,000 high
risk/high cost patients who accessed DPH\'s services between FY 11/12
and FY 18/19. The data is aggregated at the person-year level, but CPL
Berkeley will request event-level data once we have defined our specific
cohorts of interest. Key variables include:

**Medical**

-   ED visits
-   Hospital inpatient admissions
-   Urgent care visits
-   Primary and specialty care visits
-   Diagnoses

**Behavioral Health**

-   Psychiatric ED visits
-   Psychiatric inpatient admission
-   Sobering center visits
-   Detoxification
-   Methadone detoxification
-   Outpatient treatment
-   Behavioral health diagnoses

**Social Services**

-   Jail health encounter
-   Shelter stay
-   Permanent supportive housing stay
-   Conservatorship

## Data Linking {#data_linking}

We have approval to link the CCMS data to jail data from the Sheriff\'s
Department and arrest, filing, and disposition data from the District
Attorney\'s Office.
