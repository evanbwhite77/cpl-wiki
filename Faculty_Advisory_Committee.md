## Purpose/Overview

CPL\'s Faculty Advisory Committee (FAC) is comprised of a sub-set of our
Faculty Affiliates who help guide and oversee the academic direction of
the center. It generally consists of the Scientific Directors who guide
the intellectual direction of each of CPL\'s programs. This SOP provides
general information about the FAC and also serves as a how-to for staff
organizing FAC meetings.

## Timeline

The FAC meets three times annually, in January, May, and August,
although this schedule may not always be strictly followed. Meetings
typically last 2-2.5 hours.

## Steps

**1. Step One.** Schedule the meeting.

Find out when Faculty and Executive Directors are available to have a
meeting. Send a Doodle poll to the FAC members to determine their
availability. Send a calendar invite for the best time to attendees.
Reserve a room. Giannini 248 used to be the most convenient, but other
rooms will have to be used. Confirm with the HR Operations Associate and
the Deputy Director what the best option is, but consider options like
Durant Hall that are nice, free conference rooms on campus. Reserve
CPL\'s conference line as needed. Send an email to CPL affiliates asking
for new affiliate nominations. See the SOP for instructions on how to do
this.

**2. Step Two.** Create and circulate a nominee file.

Once the window for nominations has closed, the Finance & Reporting
Associate should confer with the Executive Director to finalize the list
of nominees, noting any nominees that may have been previously nominated
(based on previous nomination windows). The Finance & Reporting
Associate will generally compile information about nominees for CPL
affiliates prior to the meeting. This includes their name, title,
institution, nominator, abstracts from two published impact evaluations
in development, and CV. See example on Box here. The Finance & Reporting
Associate should then circulate the list of nominees to the FAC prior to
the meeting.

**3. Step Three.** Circulate the agenda.

The agenda will typically consist of three parts: Center-wide policy
changes under consideration. Updates from Scientific Directors on their
respective programs. Votes on new affiliate nominations. The Finance &
Reporting Associate will work with the Executive Director to determine
if any items are to be considered under bullet point 1. The Finance &
Reporting Associate will compile a file with affiliate nominations that
will be circulated alongside the agenda (again, see affiliate
nominations SOP).

**4. Step Four.** Optional. Order catering for the event. See the SOP on
Catering for more details. The Deputy Director and/or Operations Manager
can confirm if catering is needed/desired.

**5. Step Five.** Take great meeting notes. The FAC often decides to
wait on affiliate nominees to get to know them and their work better.
This should be noted in salesforce so we can invite them to events and
other meetings. Staff will also send a FAC summary when the meeting is
adjourned.

**6. Step Six.** Follow-ups. Invite nominees to CPL network (Executive
Director), once they accept remember to add them to the
cegafaculty\@berkleley.edu listserv. **(Note to Evan: need to change
this)** Notify nominators if their nominee was selected and if not,
why/next steps Conduct affiliate onboarding calls
