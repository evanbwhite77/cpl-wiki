Purpose Requesting Vacation Checklist Timeline Steps Resources

## Purpose

This section provides information on how check your vacation
leave/personal time off and sick leave balances. Full time employees
accrue approx. 10 hours of vacation per month and 8 hours of sick leave
per month. Instructions on how to record vacation leave or sick leave
taken in CalTime found in this wiki page.

## Requesting Vacation {#requesting_vacation}

If you plan to take vacation, please notify your supervisor as far in
advance as possible. Vacation requests within two weeks are not
recommended. Once approved, please notify the HR Associate who will add
to the CPL Organizational Calendar. CPL staff are often afforded
flexibility to take vacation even if they are not officially allowed to
do so (i.e. they are within their 6-month probationary period) or have
not accrued sufficient vacation hours. If you have not yet accrued
enough vacation or sick time and wish to take leave, speak with your
supervisor about using leave in advance; staffers and their managers
frequently develop informal agreements to accommodate staff vacation
(though please make sure to record terms in writing, via email). This
often involves not officially recording vacation in CalTime and then
recording vacation days in future months, once vacation time has been
accrued. Staff and managers must have a trusting relationship to do this
and should carefully track the number of vacation days / hours that need
to be claimed, with a limit of up to 1 week. Side note that it\'s not
advised to swap sick and vacation time, though this may be considered if
absolutely necessary.

## Checklist

-   To check your balance of Sick days and Vacation accrual, log into
    Caltime and click \"My Reports\" in the far right column.
-   Click on "My accrual balances and projections" in the second box
    under Available Reports, enter As Of date (ie today\'s date)
-   Click View Report

## Timeline

a month for Exempt employees and every two weeks for non-exempt
employees.

## Steps

-   To check your current balance (run an accrual report in Caltime):
-   Log into Caltime
-   Click "My Reports" from the right side of the My Timecard screen
-   Click on "My accrual balances and projections" in the second box
    under Available Reports, enter As Of date (ie today\'s date)

    rates for each (7.38 hours/mo Sick leave, 9.23 hours/mo Vacation)

    it stops rolling over, so be sure to use it or lose it if you're

To receive a projection of your vacation accrual (future date): Say
today is April 1st. I want to take a vacation August 1st and want to see
how many vacation hours I will have by August. CalTime doesn\'t give you
projections of how much vacation time you will have by a future date,
therefore use steps below:

-   If you are non-exempt employee use the accrual rates on this sheet
    to calculate future balance.
-   If you are an exempt employee use the accrual rates on this sheet to
    calculate future balance.
