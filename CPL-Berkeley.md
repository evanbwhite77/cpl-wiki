**Reimbursement: How It Works**

We now have a **Direct-entry Reimbursement system**, hurrah!

A quick note: all purchases that you intend to request reimbursement for
must be pre-approved by your supervisor. In addition, most expenses can
be purchased directly by the University, through Christina. Reach out to
your supervisor before making any purchases!

You can use the Direct Entry system for all reimbursements: Travel,
Entertainment, and Other. From the reimbursement Home Page, you will see
these three options. To submit a reimbursement request, log onto
<https://reimburse.berkeley.edu/>, and follow the steps to create and
submit a new report. Here is a step-by-step tutorial:
<https://travel.berkeley.edu/sites/default/files/how_to_submit_your_travel_reimbursement_request_directly_in_the_system.pdf>.

Once you have completed the online submission, print and save as pdf the
\'Reimbursement Report\' form from the system, make sure to complete
your reimbursement request by clicking the \"Submit to Approver\"
button. Christina will then receive a notification that you have
submitted a reimbursement request, and will proceed with processsing.

Some quick tips on navigating the process:

-   Select \'NZIIR\' as your home department.
-   Select Christina McKay from the drop-down menu as your Preferred
    Approver.
-   When entering the Expense Distribution Chartstrings on the
    \'Totals\' tab, select the Account Type first. The \'account\' data
    field will auto-populate, and you can then complete the rest of the
    chartstring fields (chartstrings listed below)

```
-   Include any and all receipts for your expenses by uploading them to
    your reimbursement request. This is embedded into the process as you
    complete a request, but forgetting to do so will cause delays in
    processing your reimbursement.

**Chartstrings**

\"Chartstrings\" are UCB\'s name for account numbers, which you\'ll be
required to enter so the system knows where to charge reimbursement.
Chartstrings are comprised of 10 separate data fields, but we only have
to provide 5.

Here are a list of commonly-used chartstrings. This list can/will change
over time but you can always see the updated version here. If you are
unsure which fund to use, email your supervisor or Christina:

-   Bylo Chacon: 71564-24463-44\--NZEVW
-   Arnold Ventures: 71361-24463-44\--NZJER
-   Miscellaneous CPL chartstring: 19900-24463-44\--

**Booking Travel**

What can you book and be reimbursed for? The University has a handy
guide on Travel Policy, which you can find here:
<https://travel.berkeley.edu/understand-policy/travel-policy-nutshell>.
Please be sure to consult the link for the full policy, but here is the
TLDR version:

-   Economy/coach airfare is all okay, including economy-premium, -plus,
    -elite. When combining a personal trip with a business trip, be sure
    to obtain a comparable airfare at the time of booking using the
    dates you would have traveled if strictly on business. Submit this
    as a screenshot or print-out along with your receipts once you are
    ready to submit your travel reimbursement request.
-   If a trip is less than 24 hours, meals are not reimbursable unless
    there was a need for an overnight stay, so keep this in mind when
    considering eating out :)
-   \$275 (excluding taxes and fees) is the daily lodging limit for
    domestic trips under 30 days. If you are required to attend a
    conference where the prearranged conference lodging rate exceeds
    maximum be sure to flag this before submitting your request. Once
    you do submit, be sure to provide an explanation and documentation
    provided with the reimbursement request.

If you are unsure whether something is reimburse-able, check in with
Christina.

**Non-travel and Entertainment Reimbursements**

All non-travel and entertainment expenses must be pre-approved by your
supervisor; most expenses can be purchased through University channels
via Christina. If you\'d like to purchase something, reach out to your
supervisor before purchasing anything. However, the process for
submitting a non-travel/entertainment expense is very similar to the
above: use the same portal (https://reimburse.berkeley.edu/), and from
the Reimbursement Home Page, create your reimbursement request under the
\"Other.\" The steps from there are the same \-- refer to the above
steps for Travel.
