Most of CPL\'s client projects have a folder within the \"CPL Main\"
google drive (\"CPL Main/Government Partnerships\"). This page provides
guidelines for the organization of this folder and its sub-folders.

## Sub-Folders {#sub_folders}

-   **Project Admin**
    -   *IRB* - This folder should contain all drafts of the IRB (if
        required), including a PDF of the final version submitted, any
        updates, and any approval letters or other correspondence
        received.
    -   *DUA*- This folder should contain all drafts of the DUA (if
        required), including PDFs of the final DUA and any amendments or
        exhibits.
    -   *OSF*
    -   *Meeting Notes*
    -   *Presentations/slide decks*
