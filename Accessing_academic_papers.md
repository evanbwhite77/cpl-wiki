There are multiple options to access academic papers through publisher
sites and [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/). A reliable way
to access them is to set up a virtual private network (VPN). This
establishes a connection to the UC Berkeley or UCLA servers. For
instructions on configuring VPN clients for your computer, phone or
tablet, please refer to the [UC Berkeley Library
page](https://www.lib.berkeley.edu/using-the-libraries/vpn) or [UCLA IT
services
page](https://www.it.ucla.edu/it-support-center/services/virtual-private-network-vpn-clients).
