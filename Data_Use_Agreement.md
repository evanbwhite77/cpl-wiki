A Data Use Agreement (DUA) is a contract that CPL typically establishes
with a data partner. The DUA governs CPL\'s use of the partner\'s data
by specifying terms such as:(a) what the data may be used for; (b) how
the data should be safeguarded; and (c) what CPL can publish relating to
the data. A major purpose of the DUA is to protect the partner and the
partner\'s data.

A DUA will typically go through several rounds of revisions as the
partner, CPL, and campus contracting officials review the terms. Each
round of revisions can take several weeks, especially, for example, if a
partner requires that multiple individuals/offices review the DUA.

Once a DUA is finalized, it is signed by all parties.
