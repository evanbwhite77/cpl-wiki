## Overview

These are housing resources for finding both short-term and long-term
housing in the Bay Area. We share this information with new staffers
moving to the Bay Area. Short-term housing options can also be useful
for visiting scholars (should UC Berkeley International House not work
out). Several of the sites below may be used for posting sublets, if you
need to sublease your current home or room.

-   It can sometimes take weeks (or longer!) to find permanent housing,
    so short term rentals/hotels may be a good option\*\* See list
    below.

[Airbnb](https://www.airbnb.com/s/Berkeley--CA)

-   Apartment/house
-   A \"long-term Airbnb\" can be a good option. You can rent for a
    series of weeks and you can book online so you have a place to stay

    comfortable place to stay while you look for apartments, purchase
    furniture, etc
