## Purpose/Overview

Donors (foundations, corporate, and individuals) want to know they're
making a difference. Updating your donors shows them that they're a part
of the cause and that the impact of their gift continues to matter.
Updates can invite donors to celebrate your progress, and even spur
further donations. Many donors who stopped giving to an organization did
so for reasons having to do with communication---they thought the
organization didn't need them, didn't get information on how the money
was used or forgot they supported the organization in the first place.
Regular updates from the Center or a program helps us to sustain our
current donor-base and inspire new donors.

## Checklist

-   Regularly record program successes in Box
-   Maintain list of donors/potential donors to your program in
    Salesforce
-   Sent drip drop updates to your donors at least quarterly

## Types of Drip Campaigns {#types_of_drip_campaigns}

There are a number of ways to update your donors and potential donors
regularly.

**1. Monthly/Quarterly E-updates**

-   Send a couple paragraphs or bullet points regarding recent program
    progress to your contacts.
-   Include a compelling photo if possible.

**2. E-Newsletters**

-   Send if you have at least a few exciting updates and images to
    share.

**3. Phone calls.** For foundation donors: share updates on regularly
scheduled calls.

-   For individual and corporate donors: Schedule phone calls to update
    donors without making an ask.

**4. Personal letters**

-   This is a nice touch for individual donors. Some donors
    (particularly older donors) prefer a printed letter.
-   Include a shot handwritten not on your letter whenever it makes
    sense.
