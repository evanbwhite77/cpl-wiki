# San Francisco Sheriff {#san_francisco_sheriff}

## Background

The San Francisco Sheriff\'s primary responsibility is managing the
county\'s four jails. They also monitor both pretrial and sentenced
persons released on electronic monitoring (EM), as well as sentenced
persons who qualify for the supervised work release. The Sheriff works
with community providers to implement 27 in-custody programs, including
the Five Keys Charter High School, addiction counseling, and vocational
training. The Sheriff\'s Department plays a very limited role in law
enforcement \-- because the county is dual jurisdiction, the police
handles nearly all law enforcement duties.

## CPL Research Partnership {#cpl_research_partnership}

The California Policy Lab at UC Berkeley is working with the San
Francisco Sheriff\'s Department on several studies, many of which are in
collaboration with the District Attorney\'s Office.

Our flagship project is an evaluation of the implementation of the
Public Safety Assessment (PSA) and the impact of statewide pretrial
policy changes in San Francisco. The study focuses on the impact that
these policy changes have on the rate of pretrial detention and
racial/ethnic disparities. It also assesses changes in public safety,
specifically the percentage of pretrial releasees appear at all court
hearings (appearance rate) and are not charged with new criminal
activity during the pretrial period (safety rate). CPL is also analyzing
San Francisco\'s local policy framework for recommending levels of
supervision (or not recommending release at all) to see if there are
opportunities to increase releases while holding public safety constant.
We are also partnering San Francisco District Attorney and San Francisco
Pretrial Diversion Project in this research.

As a result of the changing pretrial policy framework, San Francisco has
dramatically increased the numbers of people released pretrial on
electronic monitoring and to the highest level of pretrial supervision
(Assertive Case Management). CPL Berkeley is beginning a new study to
estimate the short-run effects of supervision \"dosage\" and electronic
monitoring on public safety and case outcomes for persons released
pretrial.

CPL Berkeley is also launching a new project to link individual-level
data from the Sheriff, District Attorney, and Department of Public
Health to measure the size and characteristics of frequent utilizers of
government services in San Francisco, prototypical service use pattern,
and any changes over time or difference across groups. We will use the
empirical results to understand the cycles of health service
utilization, homelessness, police contact, and incarceration; identify
the complex factors that drive their systems involvement; and model how
policy changes (such as jail discharge planning or diversion to
treatment programs) can impact outcomes.

CPL Berkeley also provides San Francisco with a monthly report of the
jail population, including number of new bookings and releases,
disaggregated by race/ethnicity. This project supports San Francisco\'s
efforts to reduce its jail population by 16% and close the seismically
unfit jail in the Hall of Justice. This work is supported by the
MacArthur Foundation\'s Safety and Justice Challenge. For more
information about San Francisco\'s strategies, see [the SJC Fact
Sheet](http://www.safetyandjusticechallenge.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/San-Francisco-Safety-Justice-Challenge-Fact-Sheet.pdf).

## Data Holdings {#data_holdings}

All jail bookings and releases since January 1, 2010 (CPL receives a
monthly report of new bookings and releases). Key variables include:

-   Date of booking and release;
-   Demographic information: the Sheriff is the only criminal justice
    agency to track whether a person identifies as non-binary and is the
    best source of ethnicity data;
-   Reason for release.

Our data use agreement also covers data from the San Francisco Pretrial
Diversion Project (SFPDP). We have data from the implementation of the
PSA (starting in May 2016) and receive quarterly updates. We also have
data for the two years prior to the implementation of the PSA. Key
variables include:

-   Risk assessment score (PSA only);
-   Recommendation for release;
-   Arraignment release decision, if eligible;
-   Arraignment release decision;
-   Failures to appear.

## Data Linking {#data_linking}

The data has been linked to:

-   Arrest, filing, and disposition data from the **San Francisco
    District Attorney\'s Office**.
-   Risk assessment scores and decisions from the **San Francisco
    Pretrial Diversion Project** (SFPDP).
-   Statewide arrest and disposition records from **California
    Department of Justice\'s** Automatic Criminal History System (ACHS).

The data is in the process of being linked to the **San Francisco
Department of Public Heath\'s** Coordinated Case Management System
(CCMS), which includes data on emergency medical, behavioral health, and
shelter usage, as well as diagnoses.
