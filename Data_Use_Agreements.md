Data Use Agreements (DUAs) are legal contracts that CPL typically
establishes with partners prior to: receipt of data at the start of a
project, receipt of new data during a project, or granting data access
to new team members during a project. This contract is generally signed
by the partner (& partner\'s counsel), CPL leadership, and university
counsel.
